##  Using Jni4Net (Part 2) - Controling OWASP ZAP remotely (via Java BeanShell REPL in .Net) 

Once I was able to [Use Jni4Net (Part 1) - To C# REPL a java process (ZAP Proxy)](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/using-jni4net-part-1-to-c-repl-java.html) I was able to use the ZAP [BeanShell ](http://www.beanshell.org/)support to start controlling and manipulating ZAP's GUI from the .Net C# REPL.

Here is an example of adding a new 'Site' (i.e. a TreeNode) to the main ZAP 'Site's window (i.e. TreeView)
