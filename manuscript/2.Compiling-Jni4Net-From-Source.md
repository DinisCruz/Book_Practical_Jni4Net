## Compiling Jni4Net from Source

After using the *git svn clone -s http://jni4net.googlecode.com/svn jni4Net* command, to create a local clone of the SVN repo:

I started by opening the **jni4net.sln** file in VS 2010.

But on first compile I had this error:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B9_25255D1.png)

which was created by the missing **selvin.exportdllattribute-0.2.6.0.dll**

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B10_25255D1.png)

which looks like should be here:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B11_25255D1.png)

let's take a look at the **v0-8-generics** branch

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B14_25255D.png)

Since it is also not there, I just downloaded it from:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B12_25255D1.png)

... and saved it to:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B15_25255D1.png)

... and updated the references

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B16_25255D1.png)

Now the code compiles, but we get this error:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B17_25255D.png)

... which is caused by this post build command:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B18_25255D.png)

... and is resolved by downloading this file:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B19_25255D.png)

... into this folder:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B20_25255D.png)

I was able to get it to compile by changing the **selvin.exportdll-0.2.6.0.exe** to **selvin.exportdll-0.2.5.0.exe** (couldn't find the 0.2.6.0 version)

Next there was a bunch of NUnit errors, which were resolved using

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B22_25255D.png)

Now we have a clean compilation (with only a bunch of warnings)

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B25_25255D1.png)

But, they all fail to execute:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B26_25255D.png)

This was a good sign that I should look for a readme.txt, which I found in the repo root (ie. RTFM when everything else fails :) )

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B27_25255D.png)

From that file I got the clue to run the loadTools.cmd script:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B28_25255D.png)

... which downloads the missing files into the lib folder:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B29_25255D.png)

Since we now have the 0.2.6.0 versions, I updated back the VS solution (and removed the nUnit package from Nuget)

Then I executed

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B30_25255D.png)

... and

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B31_25255D.png)

... this took a while, and although most looked ok:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B33_25255D.png)

... the last one failed:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B32_25255D.png)

That said, it looked like the required files seemed to have been created:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B35_25255D.png)

And the Unit tests now pass:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B34_25255D.png)

I didn't like the fact that we had that build error, so I tracked the problem to a missing NUnit installation:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B37_25255D.png)

Since I'm on a x64 VM and the path is hard-coded in the Maven script, I had to copy the installed nunit files into the expected folder:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B40_25255D1.png)

... which didn't work

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B41_25255D.png)

The problem was caused by the fact that I'm currently using an x64 JDK:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B42_25255D1.png)

Forcing a x86 (32bit) version of the JDK will do the trick

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B43_25255D.png)

Since the tests expect to find Nunit in the (x86) folder:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B44_25255D.png)

We need to rename the **NUnit-2.5.8** folder to the expected value:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B45_25255D.png)

Finally we have a successful complete build:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B46_25255D.png)

... with all created files placed inside the target folder:

![image](images/image_thumb_25255B47_25255D.png)
